DAILY is a personalized software, which integrates to-do list, real-time bookkeeping and blog diary.

This project was originally inspired by 'Microsoft Todo' App, 'pocketbook' App, 'Hexo' blog engine. Why reinvent the wheel?

- useless ancillary functions always dominate in daily use

- frequent switching separates consistent experiences, which are supposed to be integral

- I manage ~~ thousands of ~~ daily work arrangements and ~~ flow of over 100 million ~~ funds, it's more reliable to control these data by myself

- improve programming skills through practice, so that I can lose my hair faster, bald, I will become strong :)

Life should not have superfluous things, should be simpler, purer.

To get rid of complexity and obtain simpleness, the DAILY came into being.
